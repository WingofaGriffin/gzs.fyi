I am a developer advocate with a passion for getting people of all experience levels involved with technology and development with new resources. I focus on building personal connections between users to share stories and experiences. I have a particular love for open source technologies, creating readable documentation, and making the whole ecosystem more enjoyable, welcoming place to be a part of.

Outside of technology, I can be found curating the perfect Spotify playlists, finding the best new restaurants in town, and perfecting my skincare routine.

I have experience in:

- Unix: 8 years
- JavaScript: 3 years
- Python: 3 years
- C: 3 years
- Developer Relations: 2 years
- Product Management: 2 years
- Web Development: 2 years
- SQL: 2 years
