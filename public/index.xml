As a Developer Advocate, I aim to harness my passion for technology and innovation into the actions and words I use to market our product to developers around the world.
I have worked in a large variety of companies, with beginner start-ups, small non-profits, and large research organizations. I have worn just about every hat from human resources to IT to management to development.</description></item></channel></rss>
