      <description>I am a developer advocate with a passion for getting people of all experience levels involved with technology and development with new resources. I focus on building personal connections between users to share stories and experiences. I have a particular love for open source technologies, creating readable documentation, and making the whole ecosystem more enjoyable, welcoming place to be a part of.
Outside of technology, I can be found curating the perfect Spotify playlists, finding the best new restaurants in town, and perfecting my skincare routine.</description>
